curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup default stable

# Kernel headers for the guest driver (must match the kernel you'll boot)
sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential

```

---

## 1. Building the Rust workspace (backend crates)

```bash
cd /path/to/virtio-gpu-nv

# Build everything
cargo build

# Run all unit tests (GPU-present tests auto-skip if /dev/nvidiactl absent)
cargo test

# Run only the backend tests with log output
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test -p device -- --nocapture
```

### What the tests cover (Phase 1 & 2)

| Test                              | GPU needed? | What it checks             |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| `open_invalid_gpu_index`          | No          | error path, no panic       |
| `close_unknown_handle`            | No          | BadHandle status           |
| `short_request_rejected`          | No          | bounds check               |
| `open_close_nvidiactl`            | Yes         | real open/close round-trip |
| `check_version_str`               | Yes         | full simple-ioctl path     |
| `handle_table::insert_get_remove` | No          | handle lifecycle           |
| `shm::basic_alloc`                | No          | bump allocator             |
| `version::parse_ok`               | No          | version string parsing     |

---

## 2. Building the guest kernel module

The module is compiled **inside the guest VM** against the guest kernel's
build tree. For local testing you can build and `insmod` it on the host
if the host kernel matches — but the char devices will conflict with the
real NVIDIA driver, so use a dedicated test VM (see §4).

```bash
cd driver

# Against the currently-running kernel (host or guest)
make KDIR=/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build

# Output
ls virtio_gpu_nv.ko
```

---

## 3. libkrun integration (Phase 3+ — read-only for Phase 2)

`virtio-gpu-nv` is a **library** that libkrun depends on. We do not fork
or embed libkrun. The integration point is:

```toml
# In libkrun's Cargo.toml:
[dependencies]
virtio-gpu-nv-device = { path = "../virtio-nvgpu/device" }
```

For Phase 2 testing we skip libkrun entirely and use a minimal QEMU-based
test harness (§4) that implements the virtio transport directly.

---

## 4. Running an end-to-end Phase 2 test

### 4a. Architecture

```
┌─── Guest VM (QEMU) ─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  /dev/nvidiactl  ←── virtio_gpu_nv.ko ──► virtqueue          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ▲ virtio transport (vhost-user socket)
┌─── Host process ────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  test-harness   →  NvidiaBackend::dispatch()                 │
│                 →  open("/dev/nvidiactl") on host            │
│                 →  ioctl(host_fd, ...)                       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For Phase 2, we use **vhost-user** to connect QEMU's virtio device
frontend to our backend process over a Unix socket. This avoids
modifying libkrun for the test loop.

### 4b. Step-by-step

**Step 1 — Build the test harness binary**

```bash
# The test harness lives in device/bin/test-harness.rs
# (created below).  It implements a minimal vhost-user backend.

cargo build --bin test-harness
```

**Step 2 — Prepare a guest disk image**

```bash
# Download a minimal cloud image (Ubuntu 22.04 or similar)
wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/jammy/current/jammy-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
qemu-img convert -O raw jammy-server-cloudimg-amd64.img guest.raw
qemu-img resize guest.raw +10G

# Build the guest kernel module inside the image:
# Boot once with the standard virtio-net, copy the module, insmod it.
# (See Step 5 for a faster approach using 9p virtio-fs.)
```

**Step 3 — Start the test harness**

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/debug/test-harness \
    --socket /tmp/nv-vhost.sock \
    --shm-size $((256 * 1024 * 1024))
```

The harness listens on the socket, opens real `/dev/nvidia*` handles on
the host, and forwards ioctls using `NvidiaBackend::dispatch()`.

**Step 4 — Boot the guest VM**

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -enable-kvm \
    -m 4G \
    -smp 4 \
    -cpu host \
    -drive file=guest.raw,format=raw,if=virtio \
    -chardev socket,id=nv,path=/tmp/nv-vhost.sock \
    -device vhost-user-blk-pci,chardev=nv,id=nv0 \
    -object memory-backend-memfd,id=mem,size=4G,share=on \
    -numa node,memdev=mem \
    -nographic
```

> **Note:** The vhost-user device type will change to a custom virtio
> device once libkrun integration lands. For Phase 2 testing, any
> vhost-user transport that gives us a virtqueue pair is sufficient.

**Step 5 — Inside the guest: load the module**

```bash
# Copy the .ko into the guest (via virtio-9p or scp)
sudo insmod virtio_gpu_nv.ko

# Verify the char devices appeared
ls -la /dev/nvidia*
# Expected:
#   /dev/nvidiactl
#   /dev/nvidia0
#   /dev/nvidia-uvm

# Check dmesg
dmesg | grep virtio-gpu-nv
```

**Step 6 — Run the Phase 2 smoke test**

```c
// test_phase2.c — compile inside the guest
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

// NV_ESC_CHECK_VERSION_STR parameter struct
struct nv_check_version {
    char   version[64];
    unsigned int reply;
};

// _IOWR('F', 0x25, struct nv_check_version)
#define NV_IOCTL_MAGIC 'F'
#define NV_ESC_CHECK_VERSION_STR 0x25
#define NV_CHECK_VERSION_STR \
    _IOWR(NV_IOCTL_MAGIC, NV_ESC_CHECK_VERSION_STR, struct nv_check_version)

int main(void) {
    int fd = open("/dev/nvidiactl", O_RDWR);
    if (fd < 0) { perror("open"); return 1; }
    printf("open() OK, fd=%d\n", fd);

    struct nv_check_version cv;
    memset(&cv, 0, sizeof(cv));
    // Leave version[0] = '\0': driver will fill it in and set reply=1 on match.

    int rc = ioctl(fd, NV_CHECK_VERSION_STR, &cv);
    printf("ioctl rc=%d  version=\"%s\"  reply=%u\n",
           rc, cv.version, cv.reply);

    close(fd);
    printf("close() OK\n");
    return (rc == 0) ? 0 : 1;
}
```

```bash
# Inside the guest:
gcc -o test_phase2 test_phase2.c
./test_phase2
# Expected output:
#   open() OK, fd=3
#   ioctl rc=0  version="535.129.03"  reply=1
#   close() OK
```

---

## 5. Iterating quickly without a full VM

For rapid backend iteration (no kernel module needed):

```bash
# Run the backend unit tests directly on the host.
# Tests that touch /dev/nvidiactl run only if the GPU is present.
cargo test -p device -- --nocapture 2>&1 | grep -E '(PASS|FAIL|test |ok|SKIP)'
```

For testing the guest driver in isolation (no NVIDIA GPU needed):

```bash
# Use a loopback virtio-test harness: the backend replies to every
# ioctl with Status::Ok and a zeroed param buffer.
# This lets you insmod the .ko and run open()/ioctl()/close() without
# real GPU hardware.
cargo run --bin test-harness -- --mock
```

---

## 6. Phase roadmap recap

| Phase | What gets tested                                 | GPU required  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| 1     | `open()` + `close()` of `/dev/nvidiactl`         | Yes (or mock) |
| 2     | Simple ioctls (`NV_ESC_CHECK_VERSION_STR`, etc.) | Yes           |
| 3     | `NV_ESC_RM_ALLOC`, `NV_ESC_RM_CONTROL`, SHM mmap | Yes           |
| 4     | CUDA init, `/dev/nvidia-uvm`                     | Yes           |
| 5     | Full Vulkan (`vkcube`)                           | Yes           |

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

**`insmod` fails: "unknown symbol"**
Kernel version mismatch between where the module was built and where
it's being loaded. Rebuild with `KDIR` pointing at the running guest
kernel's build directory.

**`open("/dev/nvidiactl")` returns `ENODEV` in guest**
The virtio device wasn't found. Check that:

- The test harness is running and listening on the socket before QEMU starts.
- QEMU's `-device` line matches the socket path.
- `dmesg | grep virtio` shows the device being probed.

**ioctl returns `ENOTTY`**
The escape number is not in the dispatch table yet (Phase 3 ioctls).
This is expected for `NV_ESC_RM_ALLOC` etc. in Phase 2.

**ioctl returns `ENOSYS`**
The ioctl hit a Phase 3/4 stub in the backend. Same as above.

**Version string is empty / `reply=0`**
The host NVIDIA driver version does not match the ABI table in
`gen/src/versions/`. Add support for the installed version
by following the pattern in `v535_129_03.rs`.

---

## 8. Finding out why a caller gave up

A forwarded ioctl that returns `NV_OK` can still be wrong, and the caller that
reads the answer does not report what it disliked — it releases its objects and
exits. Nothing is logged on either side, so the only way through is to run the
same program twice, once against the host driver and once through the guest,
and compare what each call was **asked** and what it **answered**.

A backend log is not enough for this. It sees the request the guest sent, not
the parameter block the command points at, and it cannot see a call the guest
driver refused before sending — which is exactly the shape of failure that
leaves no trace anywhere.

### Capture

An `LD_PRELOAD` shim on `ioctl(2)` records, per call: the top-level struct, and
for `RM_CONTROL` and `RM_ALLOC` the block behind the parameter pointer, read
**before** the call and again after. The two together separate "the driver
answered something unexpected" from "nobody asked the question".

Two details the shim must get right, both learned by losing runs to them:

- **Read the parameter block through `write(2)` into a pipe**, not by
  dereferencing the pointer. Across a forwarding boundary the field can come
  back null or holding an address from another address space, and a direct read
  takes the traced program down with SIGSEGV — destroying the run that was
  supposed to explain it. `process_vm_readv` has the same property but needs
  `CROSS_MEMORY_ATTACH`, which a guest kernel may not have.
- **Snapshot before the call.** The driver writes its answer over the request,
  so afterwards there is no record of what was asked.

Run it against the host driver, then inside the guest with the same binary and
the same libraries, writing to the root filesystem so the file survives
shutdown.

### Compare

Walk both traces in lockstep, keying each record on the escape and, for
`RM_CONTROL`, the command. Report the first index where the keys differ. Before
that index, compare the parameter blocks: equal inputs with different outputs
is a wrong answer, and equal everything with a different return value is a call
one side refused.

Two things this makes cheap that were previously guesswork:

- A theory about what the caller needs can be **disproved in one command**.
  Counting the device paths a working run touches settles whether a node is on
  the path at all, and costs a line of Python rather than a day of implementing.
- The first genuinely different call is named, with both parameter blocks in
  hand. A run that ends in teardown with no error stops being a mystery and
  becomes a diff.
